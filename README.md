## Website Structure
The website will be structured with three primary HTML files:

1. **index.html**: This will serve as the homepage of the website, providing an overview of the e-commerce store. The HTML will include sections for displaying featured products, categories, and a search bar for easy navigation.

2. **product_details.html**: This HTML file will be used to display the details of a specific product. It will include information such as the product name, description, images, price, and a "buy now" button.

3. **cart.html**: This file will serve as the shopping cart page. It will list all the products added to the cart, along with their quantities and total price. It will also have options for updating quantities, removing items, and proceeding to checkout.

**Routes**:
1. **"/"**: This route will handle requests for the homepage, serving the `index.html` file to the user.

2. **"/product/*id"**: This route will accept a product `id` as a parameter and use it to retrieve product details from the database. It will then render `product_details.html`, populating it with the product information.

3. **"/add_to_cart"**: This route will handle adding a new product to the shopping cart. It will receive a product `id` and quantity as parameters and update the cart accordingly.

4. **"/view_cart"**: This route will handle requests for viewing the shopping cart. It will retrieve the current cart details from the database and render `cart.html`, populating it with the cart items.

5. **"/checkout"**: This route will initiate the checkout process. It will display the user's shipping and payment information, allowing them to review and confirm the order. Upon confirmation, it will process the order and redirect to a confirmation page.
